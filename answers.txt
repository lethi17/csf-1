Homework 3 ***(SCROLL DOWN FOR HW 4)*** 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

The variable 'linenum' has not been initialized, thus causing error.
Similarly, hashtagging go_count means never initializing it, thus causing error

Problem 4:

# Total nucleotides seen so far.
total_count = 0
# Number of G&C and A&T nucleotides seen so far.
gc_count = 0
at_count = 0

# for each base pair in the string,
for bp in seq:
    # increment the total number of bps we've seen
    total_count = total_count + 1

    # next, if the bp is a G or a C, else if bp is A or T
    if bp == 'C' or bp == 'G':
        # increment the count of gc
        gc_count = gc_count + 1
    elif bp == 'A' or bp == 'T':
        at_count = at_count + 1


# divide the gc_count by the total_count, and then divide at_count by total
gc_content = float(gc_count) / total_count
at_content = float(at_count) / total_count

# Print the answer
print 'GC-content:', gc_content
print 'AT-content:', at_content

Completed all by my lonesome

Reflection:

That was easy! Modifying the loop in problem 4 was a helpful exercise.
This is a good "don't panic" exercise, plus it's nice to see a potential
application of our learning.

Homework 4

Problem 5:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 6:

The Sum Count of all of them except test-small.fastq was off---this is because
N's are included in the DNA strands... but what could it mean?! I'm changing it 
so it instead divides by sum_count.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 2.33333333333

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content

Collaboration:
Partner with Huong worked on # 4
Completed independently. 

Reflection:

Still wondering what those N's mean. This was a great assignment! I'm beginning
to understand how the general grammar of Python functions/what you can do 
with it/etc.
